# lauzhack
This project has been created during the "Lauzhack" event in Lausanne Switzerland.

# Information
This project work with html/css/js for frontend and scala for backend.

The main goal of this project is to reduce receipt that we receive in shops. Instead of receiving paper receipt, you can scan a QR code and centralise your tickets in one single app.

In this repo you will find both environnment (enduser app and cash register) for front and the backend


# THIS PROJECT IS ONLY A PROOF OF CONCEPT !
